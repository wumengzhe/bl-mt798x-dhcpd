```

> If you want to build for arm v7l devices, you also need to install `gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi`

## Build

example:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
# mt7981, emmc device
BOARD=sn_r1 ./build.sh
# mt7981, spi-nand device, nonmbm device
BOARD=zbt_z8103ax-c VARIANT=NONMBM ./build.sh

BOARD=cmcc_a10 VERSION=SP2 MULTI_LAYOUT=1 ./build.sh
# mt7986, spi-nand device, multi-layout device, single image upgrade support
BOARD=ruijie_rg-x60-new VERSION=SP1 MULTI_LAYOUT=1 SIMG=1 ./build.sh
```

- Version (default: 2025. Optional, for different versions of ATF and U-Boot)

| Version | ATF | UBOOT |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2025 | 20250711 | 20250711 |
| SP1 | 20241017-bacca82a8 | 20250711 |
| SP2 | 20260123 | 20250711 |

> SP1: For some devices, still use the kernel 5.4 firmware, may cause some issues on version 2025, like hwrng wrong, in this case, you can try SP1.
>
> SP2: With some modifications for better compatibility with new platforms, like mt7987, or newest kernel.

- VARIANT (default: default. Optional, for different firmware variants)

> Normally, `VARIANT` is prepared for MTD devices.

| Variant | Description | Adapted Firmware |
| --- | --- | --- |
| default | Recommand for devices with stock/custom partition layout, enable MTK-NMBM, suitable for most users | stock/custom layout firmware |
| nonmbm | Recommand for devices with stock/custom partition layout, with MTK-NMBM disabled | stock/custom layout firmware without MTK-NMBM |
| ubootmod | With some modifications for better compatibility with OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt firmware | ubi/ubootmod layout firmware |
| openwrt | From OpenWrt official respository, it has no failsafe web UI temporarily | OpenWrt official firmware |

---

Other options:

| Option | type | required | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SOC | string | false | null | Auto detected, you can set SOC=mt7981, SOC=mt7986 or other mt798x platforms |
| MULTI_LAYOUT | boolean | false | 0 | You can set MULTI_LAYOUT=1 to enable multi-layout support(Only for nand devices) |
| FIXED_MTDPARTS | boolean | false | 1 | You can set FIXED_MTDPARTS=0 to make mtdparts editable, but it may cause some issues if you don't know what you are doing, so it's default to 1 to use fixed mtdparts.(Only for nand devices) |

> CAN'T ENABLE MULTI_LAYOUT=1 and FIXED_MTDPARTS=0 at the same time

Generated files will be in the `output`

## Use Actions to build

You need folk this repository to your own account, and then you can use the Actions to build the binaries, and the generated files will be in the `artifacts` or `releases` page.

- [x] Build FIP
  - [x] single-board/all/all-mt798x
  - [x] Version 2022/2023/2024/2025/2026/SP1/SP2/all

  - [ ] OC profiles

> if you want to build old versions(<2025), you can checkout the "old-version" branch
>
> version 2026 need checkout the "mtksoc-20260123" branch

## Generate GPT with python2.7

> install denpendencies

```bash
sudo apt-get install python2 python2-dev
```

> run

```bash
chmod +x generate_gpt.sh
./generate_gpt.sh
```

Generated files will be in the `output_gpt`

> You need to add your device's partition info JSON file in the "mt798x_gpt" directory, e.g. "atf-dir/tools/dev/gpt_editor/example/gpt.json".

When you enable `SDMMC=1` (e.g. `SDMMC=1 ./generate_gpt.sh`), the generated GPT image will support MTK SDMMC.

### Show GPT info

Create a directory named `mt798x_gpt_bin` in the respository root directory, and put your GPT bin files in it.

Then run:

```bash
SHOW=1 ./generate_gpt.sh
```

Then it will display the GPT partition info of all GPT bin files in `mt798x_gpt_bin` directory, and output the results to `gpt_info.txt` in the `output_gpt` directory.

### Draw GPT layout

Install `Pillow` library:

```bash
pip3 install Pillow
```

Then run:

```bash
DRAW=1 ./generate_gpt.sh
```

## Compile ATF

```bash
chmod +x compile_atf.sh
./compile_atf.sh
```

then will generate BL2 in the `output` directory. Normally, it will generate ramboot BL2.

### Overclocking profiles

Adujsting ARMPLL frequency is a **very dangerous** operation.

**It may cause some issues if you don't know what you are doing, and may cause your device to be bricked!**

So it's default to the stock frequency for safety, but you can enable the OC profiles to adjust the ARMPLL frequency, but please be careful when using it.

- For mt7981, now support OC to 1.4GHz~1.8GHz, and the OC profiles are in the `mt798x_atf/mt7981` directory.

  e.g. to build the 1.6GHz OC BL2 you need configure:

  ```makefile
  MT7981_ARMPLL_FREQ_1600=y
  ```

- For mt7986, now support OC to 2.5GHz, or underclock to 1.6GHz, and the OC profiles are in the `mt798x_atf/mt7986` directory.

  e.g. to build the 2.3GHz OC BL2 you need configure:

  ```makefile
  MT7986_ARMPLL_FREQ_2300=y
  ```

> Limit each adjustment to 100MHz for mt798x, and limit each adjustment to 50MHz for mt762x, and it's recommended to adjust the frequency step by step, e.g. from 1.6GHz to 1.7GHz, then to 1.8GHz.

ARMPLL frequency range adjustment support for different platforms:

| Version | mt7622 | mt7629 | mt7981 | mt7986 | mt7987 | mt7988 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TF-A 2024 | No | No | 1.3GHz~1.8GHz | 1.6GHz~2.5GHz | N/A | No |
| TF-A 2025 | 1.35GHz~1.7GHz | 1.2GHz~1.5GHz | 1.3GHz~1.8GHz | 1.6GHz~2.5GHz | No | No |
| TF-A 2026 | No | No | No | No | No | No |

### Other Options

these options are only work for `normal` directory

| Option | type | required | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VARIANT | string | false | null | You can set VARIANT=NONMBM/UBOOTMOD to build different BL2 variants, NONMBM means build BL2 with MTK-NMBM disabled, UBOOTMOD means build BL2 with some modifications for better compatibility with OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt firmware, but it may cause some issues if you don't know what you are doing, so it's default to null to use the default BL2 variant. |
| OC7981 | int | false | null | You can set OC7981=13-18 to build BL2 with different OC profiles for mt7981, FREQ=OC7981*100MHz, e.g. OC7981=16 means 1.6GHz, but it may cause some issues if you don't know what you are doing, so it's default to null to use the default OC profile. |
| OC7986 | int | false | null | You can set OC7986=16-25 to build BL2 with different OC profiles for mt7986, FREQ=OC7986*100MHz, e.g. OC7986=23 means 2.3GHz, but it may cause some issues if you don't know what you are doing, so it's default to null to use the default OC profile. |

## FIT support

**You MUST test it yourself, and there is a risk of BRICKING your device!**

There are two ways to build:

- Local Build

  ```bash
  BOARD=your_board VERSION=2025 VARIANT=ubootmod ./build.sh
  ```

- Use Action to build

HOW to flash:

1. Use failsafe WEB UI to backup[1*](#ENDNOTE) **all your flash and partitions**, is very **important**!

2. Update BL2 in the WEB UI to flash the preloader provided by OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt ubootmod firmware.

3. Update U-Boot in the WEB UI to flash the **FIT version FIP**.

4. Use Flash Editor in the WEB UI to erase the UBI partition(or use command line: `mtd erase ubi`), this step is only for nand devices.

5. Try upgrade in firmware upgrade page with the OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt ubootmod firmware[2*](#ENDNOTE) [3*](#ENDNOTE), if not work, try next step.

6. Use failsafe WEB UI Initramfs to boot the OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt ubootmod Initramfs image.

7. If the device can boot into OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt successfully, then you can try upgrade in firmware upgrade page with the OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt ubootmod firmware again.

---

## The best practices

1. Use TTL tools to connect to the serial port, and use [MTK UARTBOOT](https://github.com/981213/mtk_uartboot/releases) to ramboot

2. In Web UI, backup all your flash and partitions[1*](#ENDNOTE), is very important!

3. Update U-Boot in the WEB UI and upgrade firmware

4. restore backup if something goes wrong

### Change failsafe WEB UI start key

Default set `glbtn_key=reset,wps,mesh`, it means the glbtn command will search for GPIOs with labels "reset", "wps" and "mesh" in order, and use the first one found as the failsafe WEB UI start key.

The following priorities are now supported:

- `glbtn_gpio=<gpio>`
  → Directly read the GPIO.
- `glbtn_key=<label>`
  → Still search by label.

e.g.

- Specify only GPIO:
  `setenv glbtn_gpio 0`
- With the `gpio:` prefix:
  `setenv glbtn_gpio gpio:0`
  > 0, gpio 0, pio 0, gpio:0, pio0.
- Flip the signal:
  `setenv glbtn_gpio !0`
  > !gpio 0, !pio 0, !gpio:0, !pio0.
- Scan gpio-keys:
  `setenv glbtn_key wps`
  > wps, reset, mesh...

> Then you need saveenv and reboot to apply.

### Change MTD partition layout manually

Only for multi-layout devices

Set mtdparts environment variable to the partition layout you want to use, and reboot to apply.

```bash
# Current method
setenv mtd_layout <label>
# legacy method
setenv mtd_layout_label <label>
```

> Then you need saveenv and reboot to apply.

### Disable auto-reboot after upgrade

Set failsafe_auto_reboot environment variable to 1/true/yes/on to enable auto reboot after upgrade(New WEB UI).

### Some commands in firmware

```bash
fw_setenv env_invalid 1 # Reset environment to default values in next boot
fw_setenv failsafe 1 # Reboot to failsafe mode in next boot
```

> need install `uboot-envtools` and configure `package/boot/uboot-envtools/files/mediatek_filogic` correctly for your device before compile firmware, otherwise the environment variables will not work.

### Telnet support

You can connect to the device with telnet, default port is 23, and you can set the `telnet_port` environment variable to change the port.

TelnetD is enabled by default, but you can set the `telnetd_enable` environment variable to 0/false/no/off to disable it.

### Unified env-controlled NMBM enablement(Only for MTD devices)

You can set `nmbm_enable` environment variable to 0/false/no/off to disable MTK-NMBM.

> Only for MTD devices which enable MTK-NMBM configs before compile.

More information about the NMBM enablement can be found in the [unified env-controlled NMBM enablement](./document/unified-env-controlled-NMBM-enablement.md) documentation.

<a id="ENDNOTE"></a>

## Endnote

1*: If your device is a MMC device, back up all flash is not feasible. It depends on the size of the firmware, which is usually 200MB to 300MB.

2*: If your device is a MMC device, you need upgrade GPT table which has production partition, then you needn't use ubootmod firmware, you can use the OpenWrt official firmware directly.

3*: The OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt ubootmod firmware is a special firmware with FIT support, in this firmware, devicetree is loaded from the FIT image(bootargs = "root=/dev/fit0 rootwait"), and loaded from ubi_rootdisk. You'd better use a version after OpenWrt/ImmortalWrt 24.10.

---

## Old Version ( < U-Boot 2025 )

Now U-Boot 2022 and 2023 is **not maintained**(include Version2022/2023/2024).

**You can find old versions in the "old-version" branch, but they may have some issues, so it's recommended to use U-Boot 2025 for better experience.**

- <https://cmi.hanwckf.top/p/mt798x-uboot-usage>

---

## mt7621

**It only for development and testing, not recommended for production use.**

```bash
chmod +x build_mt7621.sh
BOARD=your_board ./build_mt7621.sh
```

but it not preferred, because the mt7621 u-boot has some issues on uboot-mtk-20250711, failsafe web UI is not working, and other unknown issues.

It may cause some issues if you don't know what you are doing, so it's recommended to use the [uboot-mt7621-dhcpd](https://github.com/Yuzhii0718/uboot-mt7621-dhcpd) project for mt7621 devices, which is more stable and has better support for mt7621 devices.
